`THREE.Terrain` is a **procedural terrain generation engine** for use with the
[Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) 3D graphics library for the web.

#### [Try the demo](https://icecreamyou.github.io/THREE.Terrain/)!

## Usage

You can download the script normally, or install it with npm or yarn
(`npm install three.terrain.js`). To include it on a page client-side
without a module loader:

```html
<!-- from a direct download or git clone -->
<script src="dist/THREE.Terrain.umd.js"></script>

<!-- from npm or yarn -->
<script src="node_modules/three.terrain.js/dist/THREE.Terrain.umd.js"></script>
```

You then have access to the `THREE.Terrain` object. (Make sure the `three.js`
library is loaded first.)

The latest releases of this project have been tested with three.js
[r91](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases/tag/r91).

### Procedurally Generate a Terrain

In your own script, generate a terrain and add it to your scene:

```javascript
// Generate a terrain
var xS = 63, yS = 63;
terrainScene = THREE.Terrain({
    easing: THREE.Terrain.Linear,
    frequency: 2.5,
    heightmap: THREE.Terrain.DiamondSquare,
    material: new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x5566aa}),
    maxHeight: 100,
    minHeight: -100,
    steps: 1,
    useBufferGeometry: false,
    xSegments: xS,
    xSize: 1024,
    ySegments: yS,
    ySize: 1024,
});
// Assuming you already have your global scene, add the terrain to it
scene.add(terrainScene);

// Optional:
// Get the geometry of the terrain across which you want to scatter meshes
var geo = terrainScene.children[0].geometry;
// Add randomly distributed foliage
decoScene = THREE.Terrain.ScatterMeshes(geo, {
    mesh: new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.CylinderGeometry(2, 2, 12, 6)),
    w: xS,
    h: yS,
    spread: 0.02,
    randomness: Math.random,
});
terrainScene.add(decoScene);
```

All parameters are optional and thoroughly documented in the
[source code](https://github.com/IceCreamYou/THREE.Terrain/blob/gh-pages/src/).
You can play around with some of the parameters and see what happens in the
[demo](https://icecreamyou.github.io/THREE.Terrain/).

Methods for generating terrain procedurally that are available by default
include Cosine, Diamond-Square (a better version of Midpoint Displacement),
Fault lines, Feature picking, Particle deposition, Perlin and Simplex noise,
Value noise, Weierstrass functions, Worley noise (aka Cell or Voronoi noise),
Brownian motion, arbitrary curves, and various combinations of those.

### Exporting and Importing

Export a terrain to a heightmap image:

```javascript
// Returns a canvas with the heightmap drawn on it.
// Append to your document body to view; right click to save as a PNG image.
// Note: doesn't work if you generated the terrain with `useBufferGeometry` set to `true`.
var canvas = THREE.Terrain.toHeightmap(
    // terrainScene.children[0] is the most detailed version of the terrain mesh
    terrainScene.children[0].geometry.vertices,
    { xSegments: 63, ySegments: 63 }
);
```

The result will look something like this:

![Heightmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCreamYou/THREE.Terrain/gh-pages/demo/img/heightmap.png)

Of course, the easy way to generate a heightmap (if all you need is a static
terrain) is to use the [demo](https://icecreamyou.github.io/THREE.Terrain/) and
save the generated heightmap that appears in the upper-left corner. However,
if you want to perform custom manipulations on the terrain first you will need
to export the heightmap yourself.

To import a heightmap, create a terrain as explained above, but pass the loaded
heightmap image (or a canvas containing a heightmap) to the `heightmap` option
for the `THREE.Terrain()` function (instead of passing a procedural generation
function).

If you want to export and import the scattered foliage with the terrain or if
you want to export/import the whole scene, you can do this the usual Three.js
way (currently using
[SceneExporter](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/exporters/SceneExporter.js)
and [JSONLoader](http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Loaders/JSONLoader)).
This will work just fine in general with the caveat that the exported files
will be much larger than a heightmap. Note that if you do it this way and
you're using the dynamic texture generator, you'll need to re-generate the
texture in code and apply it to the terrain.

### Dynamic Terrain Materials

When generating terrains procedurally, it's useful to automatically texture
terrains based on elevation/biome, slope, and location. A utility function is
provided that generates such a material (other than blending textures together,
it is the same as a `MeshLambertMaterial`).

```javascript
// t1, t2, t3, and t4 must be textures, e.g. loaded using `THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture()`.
// The function takes an array specifying textures to blend together and how to do so.
// The `levels` property indicates at what height to blend the texture in and out.
// The `glsl` property allows specifying a GLSL expression for texture blending.
var material = THREE.Terrain.generateBlendedMaterial([
    // The first texture is the base; other textures are blended in on top.
    {texture: t1},
    // Start blending in at height -80; opaque between -35 and 20; blend out by 50
    {texture: t2, levels: [-80, -35, 20, 50]},
    {texture: t3, levels: [20, 50, 60, 85]},
    // How quickly this texture is blended in depends on its x-position.
    {texture: t4, glsl: '1.0 - smoothstep(65.0 + smoothstep(-256.0, 256.0, vPosition.x) * 10.0, 80.0, vPosition.z)'},
    // Use this texture if the slope is between 27 and 45 degrees
    {texture: t3, glsl: 'slope > 0.7853981633974483 ? 0.2 : 1.0 - smoothstep(0.47123889803846897, 0.7853981633974483, slope) + 0.2'},
]);
```

### More

Many other utilities are provided, for example for compositing different
terrain generation methods; creating islands, cliffs, canyons, and plateaus;
manually influencing the terrain's shape at different locations; different
kinds of smoothing; and more. These features are all fully documented in the
[source code](https://github.com/IceCreamYou/THREE.Terrain/blob/gh-pages/src/).
Additionally, you can create custom methods for generating terrain or affecting
other processes.

There is also a
[simulation](https://github.com/IceCreamYou/THREE.Terrain/tree/gh-pages/statistics)
included that calculates statistics about each major procedural terrain
generation method included in the `THREE.Terrain` library.
