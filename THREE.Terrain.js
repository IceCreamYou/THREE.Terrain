 *
 * @param {Object} [options]
 *   An optional map of settings that control how the terrain is constructed
 *   and displayed. Options include:
 *
 *   - `after`: A function to run after other transformations on the terrain
 *     produce the highest-detail heightmap, but before optimizations and
 *     visual properties are applied. Takes two parameters, which are the same
 *     as those for {@link THREE.Terrain.Corner}: an array of `THREE.Vector3`
 *     objects representing the vertices of the terrain, and a map of options
 *     with the same available properties as the `options` parameter for the
 *     `THREE.Terrain` function.
 *   - `easing`: A function that affects the distribution of slopes by
 *     interpolating the height of each vertex along a curve. Valid values
 *     include `THREE.Terrain.Linear`, `THREE.Terrain.EaseInOut`,
 *     `THREE.Terrain.InEaseOut`, and any custom function that accepts a float
 *     between 0 and 1 and returns a float between 0 and 1.
 *   - `heightmap`: Either a pre-loaded image (from the same domain as the
 *     webpage or served with a CORS-friendly header) representing terrain
 *     height data (lighter pixels are higher); or a function used to generate
 *     random height data for the terrain. Valid random functions include
 *     `THREE.Terrain.Corner`, `THREE.Terrain.DiamondSquare` (the default),
 *     `THREE.Terrain.Perlin`, `THREE.Terrain.Simplex`, or a custom function
 *     with the same signature. (Ideally heightmap images have the same number
 *     of pixels as the terrain has vertices, as determined by the `xSegments`
 *     and `ySegments` options, but this is not required: if the heightmap is a
 *     different size, vertex height values will be interpolated.)
 *   - `material`: a THREE.Material instance used to display the terrain.
 *     Defaults to `new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0xee6633})`.
 *   - `maxHeight`: the highest point, in Three.js units, that a peak should
 *     reach. Defaults to 100.
 *   - `minHeight`: the lowest point, in Three.js units, that a valley should
 *     reach. Defaults to -100.
 *   - `useBufferGeometry`: a Boolean indicating whether to use
 *     THREE.BufferGeometry instead of THREE.Geometry for the Terrain plane.
 *     Defaults to `true`.
 *   - `xSegments`: The number of segments (rows) to divide the terrain plane
 *     into. (This basically determines how detailed the terrain is.) Defaults
 *     to 63.
 *   - `xSize`: The width of the terrain in Three.js units. Defaults to 1024.
 *     Rendering might be slightly faster if this is a multiple of
 *     `options.xSegments + 1`.
 *   - `ySegments`: The number of segments (columns) to divide the terrain
 *     plane into. (This basically determines how detailed the terrain is.)
 *     Defaults to 63.
 *   - `ySize`: The length of the terrain in Three.js units. Defaults to 1024.
 *     Rendering might be slightly faster if this is a multiple of
 *     `options.ySegments + 1`.

/**
 * Optimization types.
 *
 * Note that none of these are implemented right now. They should be done as
 * shaders so that they execute on the GPU, and the resulting scene would need
 * to be updated every frame to adjust to the camera's position.
 *
 * Further reading:
 * - http://vterrain.org/LOD/Papers/
 * - http://vterrain.org/LOD/Implementations/
 *
 * GEOMIPMAP: The terrain plane should be split into sections, each with their
 * own LODs, for screen-space occlusion and detail reduction. Intermediate
 * vertices on higher-detail neighboring sections should be interpolated
 * between neighbor edge vertices in order to match with the edge of the
 * lower-detail section. The number of sections should be around sqrt(segments)
 * along each axis. It's unclear how to make materials stretch across segments.
 *
 * GEOCLIPMAP: The terrain should be composed of multiple donut-shaped sections
 * at decreasing resolution as the radius gets bigger. When the player moves,
 * the sections should morph so that the detail "follows" the player around.
 * There is an implementation of geoclipmapping at
 * https://github.com/CodeArtemis/TriggerRally/blob/unified/server/public/scripts/client/terrain.coffee
 * and a tutorial on morph targets at
 * http://nikdudnik.com/making-3d-gfx-for-the-cinema-on-low-budget-and-three-js/
 *
 * POLYGONREDUCTION: Combine areas that are relatively coplanar into larger
 * polygons as described at http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=142.
 * This method can be combined with the others if done very carefully, or it
 * can be adjusted to be more aggressive at greater distance from the camera
 * (similar to combining with geomipmapping).
 *
 * If these do get implemented, here is the option description to add to the
 * `THREE.Terrain` docblock:
 *
 *    - `optimization`: the type of optimization to apply to the terrain. If
 *      an optimization is applied, the number of segments along each axis that
 *      the terrain should be divided into at the most detailed level should
 *      equal (n * 2^(LODs-1))^2 - 1, for arbitrary n, where LODs is the number
 *      of levels of detail desired. Valid values include:
 *
 *          - `THREE.Terrain.NONE`: Don't apply any optimizations. This is the
 *            default.
 *          - `THREE.Terrain.GEOMIPMAP`: Divide the terrain into evenly-sized
 *            sections with multiple levels of detail. For each section,
 *            display a level of detail dependent on how close the camera is.
 *          - `THREE.Terrain.GEOCLIPMAP`: Divide the terrain into donut-shaped
 *            sections, where detail decreases as the radius increases. The
 *            rings then morph to "follow" the camera around so that the camera
 *            is always at the center, surrounded by the most detail.

/**
 * Generate a material that blends together textures based on vertex height.
 *
 * Inspired by http://www.chandlerprall.com/2011/06/blending-webgl-textures/
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *    // Assuming the textures are already loaded
 *    var material = THREE.Terrain.generateBlendedMaterial([
 *      {texture: THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture('img1.jpg')},
 *      {texture: THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture('img2.jpg'), levels: [-80, -35, 20, 50]},

 *    ]);
 *
 * This material tries to behave exactly like a MeshLambertMaterial other than
 * the fact that it blends multiple texture maps together, although
 * ShaderMaterials are treated slightly differently by Three.js so YMMV. Note
 * that this means the texture will appear black unless there are lights
 * shining on it.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} textures
 *   An array of objects specifying textures to blend together and how to blend
 *   them. Each object should have a `texture` property containing a
 *   `THREE.Texture` instance. There must be at least one texture and the first
 *   texture does not need any other properties because it will serve as the
 *   base, showing up wherever another texture isn't blended in. Other textures
 *   must have either a `levels` property containing an array of four numbers
 *   or a `glsl` property containing a single GLSL expression evaluating to a
 *   float between 0.0 and 1.0. For the `levels` property, the four numbers
 *   are, in order: the height at which the texture will start blending in, the
 *   height at which it will be fully blended in, the height at which it will
 *   start blending out, and the height at which it will be fully blended out.
 *   The `vec3 vPosition` variable is available to `glsl` expressions; it
 *   contains the coordinates in Three-space of the texel currently being
 *   rendered.

 *   following properties:
 *   - `mesh`: A `THREE.Mesh` instance to scatter across the terrain.
 *   - `spread`: A number or a function that affects where meshes are placed.
 *     If it is a number, it represents the percent of faces of the terrain
 *     onto which a mesh should be placed. If it is a function, it takes a
 *     vertex from the terrain and the key of a related face and returns a
 *     boolean indicating whether to place a mesh on that face or not. An
 *     example could be `function(v, k) { return v.z > 0 && !(k % 4); }`.
 *     Defaults to 0.025.
 *   - `scene`: A `THREE.Object3D` instance to which the scattered meshes will
 *     be added. This is expected to be either a return value of a call to
 *     `THREE.Terrain()` or added to that return value; otherwise the position
 *     and rotation of the meshes will be wrong.
 *   - `sizeVariance`: The percent by which instances of the mesh can be scaled
 *     up or down when placed on the terrain.
 *   - `randomness`: If `options.spread` is a number, then this property is a
 *     function that determines where meshes are placed. Valid values include
 *     `Math.random` and the return value of a call to
 *     `THREE.Terrain.ScatterHelper`.
 *   - `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`: Together, these properties outline a rectangular
 *     region on the terrain inside which meshes should be scattered. The `x`
 *     and `y` properties indicate the upper-left corner of the box and the `w`
 *     and `h` properties indicate its width and height, respectively, in units
 *     of terrain segments (like those specified in the `options` parameter for
 *     the `THREE.Terrain` function). `x` and `y` default to zero, but `w` and
 *     `h` are required.
 *
 * @return {THREE.Object3D}
 *   An Object3D containing the scattered meshes. This is the value of the

/**
 * Generate a function that returns a heightmap to pass to ScatterMeshes.
 *
 * @param {Function} method
 *   A random terrain generation function (i.e. a valid value for the
 *   `options.heightmap` parameter of the `THREE.Terrain` function).
 * @param {Object} options
 *   A map of settings that control how the resulting noise should be generated
 *   (with the same parameters as the `options` parameter to the
 *   `THREE.Terrain` function, although typically only the `xSegments` and
 *   `ySegments` fields are used). `options.minHeight` must equal `0` and
 *   `options.maxHeight` must equal `1` if they are specified.
 * @param {Number} skip
 *   The number of sequential faces to skip between faces that are candidates
 *   for placing a mesh. This avoid clumping meshes too closely together.
 *
 * @return {Function}
 *   Returns a function that can be passed as the value of the
 *   `options.randomness` parameter to the {@link THREE.Terrain.ScatterMeshes}
 *   function.
