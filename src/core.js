/**
 * A terrain object for use with the Three.js library.
 *
 * Usage: `var terrainScene = THREE.Terrain();`
 *
 * @param {Object} [options]
 *   An optional map of settings that control how the terrain is constructed
 *   and displayed. Options include:
 *
 *   - `after`: A function to run after other transformations on the terrain
 *     produce the highest-detail heightmap, but before optimizations and
 *     visual properties are applied. Takes two parameters, which are the same
 *     as those for {@link THREE.Terrain.DiamondSquare}: an array of
 *     `THREE.Vector3` objects representing the vertices of the terrain, and a
 *     map of options with the same available properties as the `options`
 *     parameter for the `THREE.Terrain` function.
 *   - `easing`: A function that affects the distribution of slopes by
 *     interpolating the height of each vertex along a curve. Valid values
 *     include `THREE.Terrain.Linear` (the default), `THREE.Terrain.EaseIn`,
 *     `THREE.Terrain.EaseOut`, `THREE.Terrain.EaseInOut`,
 *     `THREE.Terrain.InEaseOut`, and any custom function that accepts a float
 *     between 0 and 1 and returns a float between 0 and 1.
 *   - `frequency`: For terrain generation methods that support it (Perlin,
 *     Simplex, and Worley) the octave of randomness. This basically controls
 *     how big features of the terrain will be (higher frequencies result in
 *     smaller features). Often running multiple generation functions with
 *     different frequencies and heights results in nice detail, as
 *     the PerlinLayers and SimplexLayers methods demonstrate. (The counterpart
 *     to frequency, amplitude, is represented by the difference between the
 *     `maxHeight` and `minHeight` parameters.) Defaults to 2.5.
 *   - `heightmap`: Either a canvas or pre-loaded image (from the same domain
 *     as the webpage or served with a CORS-friendly header) representing
 *     terrain height data (lighter pixels are higher); or a function used to
 *     generate random height data for the terrain. Valid random functions are
 *     specified in `generators.js` (or custom functions with the same
 *     signature). Ideally heightmap images have the same number of pixels as
 *     the terrain has vertices, as determined by the `xSegments` and
 *     `ySegments` options, but this is not required. If the heightmap is a
 *     different size, vertex height values will be interpolated.) Defaults to
 *     `THREE.Terrain.DiamondSquare`.
 *   - `material`: a THREE.Material instance used to display the terrain.
 *     Defaults to `new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0xee6633})`.
 *   - `maxHeight`: the highest point, in Three.js units, that a peak should
 *     reach. Defaults to 100. Setting to `undefined`, `null`, or `Infinity`
 *     removes the cap, but this is generally not recommended because many
 *     generators and filters require a vertical range. Instead, consider
 *     setting the `stretch` option to `false`.
 *   - `minHeight`: the lowest point, in Three.js units, that a valley should
 *     reach. Defaults to -100. Setting to `undefined`, `null`, or `-Infinity`
 *     removes the cap, but this is generally not recommended because many
 *     generators and filters require a vertical range. Instead, consider
 *     setting the `stretch` option to `false`.
 *   - `steps`: If this is a number above 1, the terrain will be paritioned
 *     into that many flat "steps," resulting in a blocky appearance. Defaults
 *     to 1.
 *   - `stretch`: Determines whether to stretch the heightmap across the
 *     maximum and minimum height range if the height range produced by the
 *     `heightmap` property is smaller. Defaults to true.
 *   - `turbulent`: Whether to perform a turbulence transformation. Defaults to
 *     false.
 *   - `useBufferGeometry`: a Boolean indicating whether to use
 *     THREE.BufferGeometry instead of THREE.Geometry for the Terrain plane.
 *     Defaults to `false`.
 *   - `xSegments`: The number of segments (rows) to divide the terrain plane
 *     into. (This basically determines how detailed the terrain is.) Defaults
 *     to 63.
 *   - `xSize`: The width of the terrain in Three.js units. Defaults to 1024.
 *     Rendering might be slightly faster if this is a multiple of
 *     `options.xSegments + 1`.
 *   - `ySegments`: The number of segments (columns) to divide the terrain
 *     plane into. (This basically determines how detailed the terrain is.)
 *     Defaults to 63.
 *   - `ySize`: The length of the terrain in Three.js units. Defaults to 1024.
 *     Rendering might be slightly faster if this is a multiple of
 *     `options.ySegments + 1`.

/**
 * Optimization types.
 *
 * Note that none of these are implemented right now. They should be done as
 * shaders so that they execute on the GPU, and the resulting scene would need
 * to be updated every frame to adjust to the camera's position.
 *
 * Further reading:
 * - http://vterrain.org/LOD/Papers/
 * - http://vterrain.org/LOD/Implementations/
 *
 * GEOMIPMAP: The terrain plane should be split into sections, each with their
 * own LODs, for screen-space occlusion and detail reduction. Intermediate
 * vertices on higher-detail neighboring sections should be interpolated
 * between neighbor edge vertices in order to match with the edge of the
 * lower-detail section. The number of sections should be around sqrt(segments)
 * along each axis. It's unclear how to make materials stretch across segments.
 * Possible example (I haven't looked too much into it) at
 * https://github.com/felixpalmer/lod-terrain/tree/master/js/shaders
 *
 * GEOCLIPMAP: The terrain should be composed of multiple donut-shaped sections
 * at decreasing resolution as the radius gets bigger. When the player moves,
 * the sections should morph so that the detail "follows" the player around.
 * There is an implementation of geoclipmapping at
 * https://github.com/CodeArtemis/TriggerRally/blob/unified/server/public/scripts/client/terrain.coffee
 * and a tutorial on morph targets at
 * http://nikdudnik.com/making-3d-gfx-for-the-cinema-on-low-budget-and-three-js/
 *
 * POLYGONREDUCTION: Combine areas that are relatively coplanar into larger
 * polygons as described at http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=142.
 * This method can be combined with the others if done very carefully, or it
 * can be adjusted to be more aggressive at greater distance from the camera
 * (similar to combining with geomipmapping).
 *
 * If these do get implemented, here is the option description to add to the
 * `THREE.Terrain` docblock:
 *
 *    - `optimization`: the type of optimization to apply to the terrain. If
 *      an optimization is applied, the number of segments along each axis that
 *      the terrain should be divided into at the most detailed level should
 *      equal (n * 2^(LODs-1))^2 - 1, for arbitrary n, where LODs is the number
 *      of levels of detail desired. Valid values include:
 *
 *          - `THREE.Terrain.NONE`: Don't apply any optimizations. This is the
 *            default.
 *          - `THREE.Terrain.GEOMIPMAP`: Divide the terrain into evenly-sized
 *            sections with multiple levels of detail. For each section,
 *            display a level of detail dependent on how close the camera is.
 *          - `THREE.Terrain.GEOCLIPMAP`: Divide the terrain into donut-shaped
 *            sections, where detail decreases as the radius increases. The
 *            rings then morph to "follow" the camera around so that the camera
 *            is always at the center, surrounded by the most detail.
